A game I have lots of awesome ideas for.
TODOS:
  - server side integration, am thinking node.js so I can run the same logic both places to validate moves
  - add tests (what am I crazy!?)
  - use closure (I'm defintally crazy!)

These are my 4am notes:

Multiplayer
Bigger board, two people competing to get highest score.

Multiplayer Battle mode:
same except every once in a while a stat appears instead of a circle,
first person to get it will get a tool to get an advantage. I.e. click
to destroy opponents dot, swap board, swap scores, freeze all
opponents, (alternativly the user has to Ice-pick away at dots thy want to use
or wait until ice melts). Score increase, swap your own dots,
sabagatage, the next time opponent clicks one of their dots it will
change colors, they won't know it happened.

In order to get battle stars you have to do a square of that circle.
alternativly only 1 available at a time. You can use it like normal if you like
for a score boost but better to draw circle with its color.

Additionally we could have a turn based counter in the game that did
certain things (think weather in gunbound

Additionally we could have a slot
Machine in game (battle). Or after game for more points

Multiples mode split the game board into 3 vertical pieces. Left is
player a. Middle is shared, and right is player c.

King of the hill: last idea as well as have a mode where the better
you do the more center pieces You take over.

Puzzle mode where you try to solve levels with fewest turns possible
without regenerating the board (also not random). (Stars for perfect,
acceptable, poor

More multiplayer things you should be able to do. Steal: play on the
other personas board, or steal v2: their next move you get the points
for.

If time based game you could get something that speeds up the timer
and or slows down the timer
For you or the opponent.

Longer trails for more points
Boxes and then tails for more points
Big boxes for more points
